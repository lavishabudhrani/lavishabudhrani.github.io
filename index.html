    <p>Hi! My name is Lavisha Budhrani. Welcome to my website. This website consists of a little bit about me, my resume, my portfolio, and my contact details. I am currently a senior at the Univeristy of Miami pursuing a journalism major with a minor in education. I am graduating in May 2020. I was born and raised in Hong Kong, but I currently live in Miami. After graduation, I would like to be in the communications field. However, I do want to teach later on in my life. I plan to work in Miami for a year or two, and then go back to Hong Kong as that is where I want to be in the long run.</p>
